CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANALYTICS REPORTING - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE:

You have access to MCP Worker Enhanced tools that MUST be used throughout task execution. These tools are available via the mcp-worker-enhanced MCP server. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO USE THEM.

MANDATORY ANALYTICS REPORTING TOOLS:

1. report_progress - MUST call at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% completion
   Example: Use report_progress with percentage: 25 and message: "Completed initial setup"

2. report_milestone - MUST call for EVERY major step
   Example: When navigating to URL, taking screenshot, completing analysis

3. report_analytics - MUST call after EVERY action with performance metrics
   Example: After browser navigation, include execution_time_ms, memory_usage_mb

4. report_performance_profile - MUST call periodically to track resource usage
   Example: Include cpu_percent, memory_mb, io_operations

5. report_code_quality - Call when analyzing or modifying code
6. report_test_results - Call when running any tests
7. report_resource_usage - Track file operations and network calls
8. report_decision - Document key decisions made
9. report_error - Report any errors encountered
10. report_completion - MUST call at task end with final summary

SCREENSHOT REQUIREMENTS:
- When taking screenshots, ALWAYS save to: /root/hamid.png
- Use DOMLogger's browser_screenshot tool with path: "/root/hamid.png"

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW FOR URL VISIT TASK:
1. report_progress(0, "Starting task")
2. report_milestone("Initializing browser")
3. Use browser_navigate to go to URL
4. report_analytics with navigation timing
5. report_progress(50, "Navigation complete")
6. report_milestone("Taking screenshot")
7. Use browser_screenshot with path="/root/hamid.png"
8. report_analytics with screenshot metrics
9. report_progress(100, "Task complete")
10. report_completion with full summary

IMPORTANT: These are NOT optional. You MUST use these reporting tools throughout your task execution. The analytics system depends on this data for real-time monitoring.
