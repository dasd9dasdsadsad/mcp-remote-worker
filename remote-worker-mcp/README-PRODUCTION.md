## 🌍 Deployment Options

### Local Testing
- Deploy on same server as manager
- Use `MANAGER_HOST=localhost`
- Quick iteration and testing

### Remote Production
- Deploy on any server worldwide
- Set `MANAGER_HOST=<MANAGER_IP>`
- Requires open ports: 4222, 6379, 5432

### Multi-Region
- Deploy workers in multiple regions
- All connect to central manager
- Geographic distribution for performance

### Auto-Scaling
- Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes
- Scale workers based on task queue
- Health checks and auto-restart

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
MANAGER_HOST=<manager-server-ip>    # Required
CURSOR_API_KEY=<your-api-key>       # Required
```

### Optional Configuration

```bash
WORKER_TAGS="mcp,docker,remote,production"
MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=5
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS=10000
NATS_PORT=4222
REDIS_PORT=6379
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

1. **Distributed Task Execution**
   - Run tasks on remote servers
   - Geographic distribution
   - Load balancing

2. **Web Scraping/Automation**
   - Browser automation with domlogger
   - Screenshot capture
   - Data extraction

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automated testing
   - Build processes
   - Deployment tasks

4. **Multi-tenant Systems**
   - Isolated worker environments
   - Per-client containers
   - Resource allocation

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Network Security**
   - Use TLS for all connections
   - Firewall rules for ports
   - VPN for sensitive data

2. **API Keys**
   - Use secrets management
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Monitor usage

3. **Container Security**
   - Run as non-root user
   - Limit resources
   - Regular image updates

4. **Database**
   - Strong passwords
   - Encrypted connections
   - Regular backups

## 📈 Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- Worker uptime
- Task completion rate
- Average execution time
- Error rate
- Heartbeat latency

### Log Aggregation

```bash
# View worker logs
docker logs mcp-worker -f

# Check specific task
docker logs mcp-worker | grep <task-id>
```

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Active workers
SELECT * FROM remote_workers 
WHERE last_heartbeat > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 minute';

-- Task statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'task_completed' THEN 1 END) as completed
FROM remote_worker_events
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Worker not appearing
**Solution:** Check logs, verify network, ensure services accessible

### Issue: Tasks not executing
**Solution:** Verify cursor-agent installed, check API key

### Issue: Connection timeouts
**Solution:** Check firewall rules, verify ports open

### Issue: High memory usage
**Solution:** Reduce MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS, monitor container resources

## 📞 Support
